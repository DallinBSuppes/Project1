## Final Review

Honestly I thought I had a good grip on this project but I think I have overthought it and made it out to be more than it is. As I went through everything and looking through the CSS I had difficulty seeing what was a problem. Everything directly related and made the page work well. When the links were clicked it would bring it to the section the link was related to. So All I really did, and I feel there was more to do I just got confused, was add comments, move some of the css around so that everything that was related brought together, and thats really it. I am hoping to get feedback on what to improbe, because when I tried to shorten some css here and there it made the webpage totally wrong. I for sure need to do better in the future with asking questions and using office hours, I just didnt deligate my time better which I am planning on doing better in the future.
